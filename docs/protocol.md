# HTTP and WebSocket protocol

This document describes routes mapped by the current API. Unless marked public, HTTP requests require `Authorization: Bearer <opaque-access-token>`.

## Health

| Method | Route | Auth | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health/live` | Public | Process liveness only; excludes registered dependency checks. |
| `GET` | `/health/ready` | Public | Checks PostgreSQL and Redis. |

Swagger is enabled by default only in Development, or when `Swagger:Enabled=true`.

## Authentication

`MapIdentityApi<ApplicationUser>` maps the standard ASP.NET Core Identity API under `/auth`: `/register`, `/login`, `/refresh`, `/confirmEmail`, `/resendConfirmationEmail`, `/forgotPassword`, `/resetPassword`, `/manage/2fa` and `/manage/info`. The framework owns their request/response contracts. This project additionally maps:

| Method | Route | Auth | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Required | Returns `204`; it does not revoke already issued self-contained bearer tokens. |
| `GET` | `/auth/me` | Required | Returns `id`, `email`, `displayName`, `emailConfirmed`, `createdAt` and `lastLoginAt`. |

For desktop/mobile login, omit cookies or use `POST /auth/login?useCookies=false`. The response contains an opaque bearer access token, expiry and refresh token; it is not a JWT.

```json
{
  "tokenType": "Bearer",
  "accessToken": "<opaque-access-token>",
  "expiresIn": 900,
  "refreshToken": "<opaque-refresh-token>"
}
```

Login and refresh use fixed-window, IP-keyed rate limits.

## Devices

All device routes require authentication, but their current handlers are stubs.

| Method | Route | Current behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/devices/` | Returns `201 Created` without creating a device or response body. |
| `GET` | `/api/devices/` | Returns `200 OK` without a device collection body. |
| `GET` | `/api/devices/{deviceId}` | Returns `200` with the route `deviceId`; no lookup or ownership check. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/devices/{deviceId}` | Returns `200` with the route `deviceId`; no update. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/devices/{deviceId}` | Returns `204`; no deletion. |
| `POST` | `/api/devices/{deviceId}/revoke` | Returns `200` with `deviceId` and `revoked: true`; no persistence. |

Session routes do perform real device ownership/revocation checks against PostgreSQL. Consequently, the public device lifecycle is not yet usable end to end.

## Sessions

All session routes require authentication.

| Method | Route | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/` | Creates a waiting session and publisher participant for an owned, non-revoked source device; returns `201` and a six-character code. |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/active` | Lists waiting/active sessions owned by or joined by the caller, including connected viewer count. |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{sessionId}` | Returns a session to its owner or participant; inaccessible sessions return `404`. |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/end` | Owner-only; marks the session ended, disconnects participants and removes the Redis code. Idempotently returns the ended session. |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{sessionId}/rotate-code` | Owner-only; rejects ended/expired sessions with `409`, invalidates the previous code and returns a new code. |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/join` | Resolves a valid code and owned viewer device, enforces the viewer limit, creates/reconnects a participant and activates a waiting session. |

Create request:

```json
{ "sourceDeviceId": "<uuid>", "maxViewers": 3 }
```

`maxViewers` defaults to `Sessions:MaxViewersPerSession` and must be at least one. There is currently no upper bound.

Join request:

```json
{ "code": "ABC123", "deviceId": "<uuid>" }
```

Codes are trimmed, uppercased and must contain exactly six ASCII letters/digits. Wrong, malformed, expired and terminal-session codes all return `404` with the same error. Despite the store method name `RedeemAsync`, a successful lookup does not consume the code; it remains reusable until rotation, session end or expiry.

Session responses contain `id`, `ownerUserId`, `sourceDeviceId`, `status`, `maxViewers`, `codeExpiresAt`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`, `createdAt`, and `code` when a new code is issued.

## WebSocket signaling

Connect with an authenticated WebSocket upgrade:

```text
GET /ws/signaling?sessionId={uuid}&deviceId={uuid}
Authorization: Bearer <opaque-access-token>
```

Before upgrade, the API verifies:

- both query parameters are UUIDs;
- the session exists and is not ended, expired or past `codeExpiresAt`;
- the device belongs to the authenticated user and is not revoked;
- a participant matches the session, user and device.

Validation failures return HTTP `400`, `401`, `403`, `404` or `410` before the upgrade. Every server frame uses this envelope:

```json
{
  "type": "session.joined",
  "messageId": "<uuid>",
  "sessionId": "<uuid>",
  "from": null,
  "to": "<participant-uuid>",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-04T14:00:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "participantId": "<participant-uuid>",
    "role": "publisher"
  }
}
```

### Client messages

Clients send the same envelope shape. `type` is required. `messageId` may be supplied as a UUID and is preserved; otherwise the server generates it. Client `sessionId`, `from`, and `timestamp` values are never trusted. The server derives the session from the connection, overwrites `from` with the authenticated participant, and assigns its own timestamp.

`ping` requires no recipient and produces an enveloped `pong`. These routed types require a UUID `to` participant in the same live session and may include any JSON `payload`:

- `publisher.ready`
- `viewer.ready`
- `webrtc.offer`
- `webrtc.answer`
- `webrtc.ice_candidate`
- `pong`

The server emits a normalized routed frame:

```json
{
  "type": "webrtc.offer",
  "messageId": "<uuid>",
  "sessionId": "<uuid>",
  "from": "<sender-participant-uuid>",
  "to": "<recipient-participant-uuid>",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-04T14:00:00Z",
  "payload": {}
}
```

`session.joined`, `session.left`, `session.ended`, and `error` are server-generated types and are rejected when sent by a client. Routing is constrained to the current session. Errors use the canonical envelope with `type: "error"` and a payload such as `{ "code": "participant_not_found" }`. Other error codes are `invalid_message`, `unsupported_message_type` and `invalid_recipient`.

SDP and ICE payloads are opaque JSON to the API. SDP describes the peer media/session parameters, and ICE candidates describe network paths discovered by the peers. The server forwards those payloads unchanged and never writes their content to logs; routing logs contain only message type, session ID, sender ID, recipient ID, and message ID.

Text messages may be fragmented but may not exceed 64 KiB. Binary frames are rejected. Disconnects broadcast `session.left` to other live participants. When the session becomes terminal, the server sends `session.ended` and closes routing for that connection. There is no persisted signaling history; `SignalingEvent` is mapped in EF Core but the endpoint does not write it.
